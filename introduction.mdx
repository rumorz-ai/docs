## ðŸš€ Vision

Rumorz provides investors and traders their own AI agents, aligned with their goals and preferences and with 24/7 access to real-time, institutional grade financial data and analytics.

## ðŸ§  How does it work?

**The Graph**

Our AI Agents ingest 100s of pages of text a day into a knowledge graph (the Graph), allowing fast semantic retrieval of market data and text data from news, research, social media. The Graph indexes data on 1200 crypto tokens in real-time, making it available to agents for research or decision making.

This is ideal for AI use cases, and has been built from scratch without the constraints of legacy tables or complicated joins.&#x20;

**Agents**

Agents are autonomous and run research and analysis for you 24/7. You don't need to prompt them or think of questions to ask. You can simply give them a goal, and they will go from there. They will start doing research and analysis and come up with a strategy to achieve your goal.
