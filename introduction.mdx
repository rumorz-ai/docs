We are currently open only via API. Agents will be deployed in the web app starting January 2025.

## ðŸ§  How does it work?

* **The Graph**

Our AI Agents ingest 100s of pages of text a day into a knowledge graph (the Graph), allowing fast semantic retrieval of market data and text data from news, research, social media. The Graph indexes data on 1200 crypto tokens in real-time, making it available to agents for research or decision making.
